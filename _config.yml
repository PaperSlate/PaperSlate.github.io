user_description: Hi there! I'm Mo, an aspiring UI/UX Designer. I recently graduated from Georgia Tech with a BS in Computer Science. My focus is in Human-Computer Interaction and Media Creation. I'm particularly interested in UI/UX, fluid graphics, and game design. When not programming or designing, you can find me gaming, exploring fountain pens, surfing Reddit, or building a pc! Check out some of my past work below.
